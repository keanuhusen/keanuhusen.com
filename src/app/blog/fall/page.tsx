          <div className="mt-4 text-lg text-[#007E80] text-pretty md:text-xl">
            <p>I&apos;m currently based in Birmingham, AL.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I miss my home state of California. I miss surfing at dawn with my buddies. I miss the deep Bible talks I had with my friends whom I served in ministry with for years. I miss the scent of an espresso shot mixed with the fresh salt-infused breeze in the morning... but enough about what I miss. We look to the future and I love this hidden gem they call the Iron City.</p>
            <br />
            <p>When I first moved to Birminingham, in the fall of 2021, I knew abasolutely nobody. Now, I have friends... like a lot of friends... like so many friends that I am overwhelemed because peole just always want to hang out with me, but I need to figure out how to let them know that I have limited time. But hey, look what the Lord has done.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I live in a great townhouse with extremely cheap rent and 2 awesome roommates (I&apos;m not married yet... not even close &mdash; in faith pray for your boy to find a wife).</p>
            <br />
            <p>This is a long-winded bio &mdash; I know. I say all this, but I really only want to say one thing to you: I miss how closely I relied on the Holy Spirit of God when I lived in the crappiest apartment and had absolutely nobody in life to turn to. I miss having the Holy Spirit as my best friend. I don&apos;t tell people often enough, but I miss living with passion and purpose for Christ. I miss the freshness, the wonder, the awe, the fear, the drive, and the desire of pursuing Christ. Is it true that knowing God can become boring or old news? I cannot accept this.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I feel as though I&apos;ve somehow lost sight of my calling and somehow disheartened to the pick up the mantle of the call I once was certain of, but now feel apathetic towards. How can this be? How can a man leave all he has ever known only to give up and give in to a sendentary life 3 years in? I must confess, it most certainly must be because I have exchanged my love for God with love for self.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Do I love myself more than I love the Lord? Yes. Unequivocally yes. How can I know this to be true? I think of the hours I have spent serving the church on Sunday or Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday, or any other day that ends with day. But that may be at the very heart of the issue. I have traded my birth-right for a bowl of soup. Like Mary &amp; martha, I have exchanged my seat at the feet of Jesus with the broom of busyness and lethargic work.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Do not misinpret. Work must be done. The house must be swept, but the thing of greater weight in one&apos;s life is simply sitting at the feet of Jesus. To put it plainly, the most important thing one can do is to love God &mdash; to love Jesus.</p>
            <br />
            <p>So what am I to do? I have now acknowledged this lack in my life. This closeness that once was, but is no longer. How can I rekindle my friendship with God? I suppose it is simply just that. Like any friendship, I am required to put in effort. I must respond to the text. I must respond to the call. I must carve out time from my &ldquo;busy&rdquo; schedule and create an appointment to meet with the Lord. And then to meet again. And again. And again. And... well, you get the point.</p>
            <br />
            <p>I shall once again be called a friend of God. I shall once again have a glow like Moses. More than a fresh encounter with the Lord, I will have a new   altar and thus a new habitat made for the Lord to dwell in. And the Lord shall inhabit the praise of his people. He will inhabit the praise of this once dying branch that is now pruned and lifted. And this branch is eager for the Spring and its fruit to sprout forth once again.</p>
